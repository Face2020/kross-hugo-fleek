## **F.A.Q.**

**DOES  A FACE-WORKOUT CHANGE THE QUALITY OF MY SKIN?**

Yes, it does change the skin from inside out as a result of the better blood circulation and improvement of the capillar structure of the skin. The skin breathes bettter, has more nurishment and a better colour.

**CAN YOU SEE THE EFFECT AFTER ONE TRAINING?**

You can't see the effect after one training it takes at least 10 days. Without discipline and regular training, none of the methods will work on long term base. We only use natural techniques to stimulate cell regeneration and awaken the anti age function of the body. Follow the online training and get amazing results!
