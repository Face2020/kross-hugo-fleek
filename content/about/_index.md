Are you thinking on using botox or injectables?

Would you like to remove crow's feet beside the eyes, the nasal-labial fold, the vertical folds around the mouth,the frown lines and the second chin?

Would you like to have a full mouth and fleshy cheeks ?

**This is all possible with exercises for the face muscles.**

Workout 5-7 minutes a day and start the way to a wrinkle free & youthful look.

By starting at the age of 25 you will retain a wrinkle free face.

By starting at the age of 45/50, within 2 to 3 months you will look 7 years younger.

## **F.A.Q.**

**DOES FACE-GYM CHANGE THE QUALITY OF MY SKIN?**

Face-gym does change the skin from inside out as a result of the better blood circulation and improvement of the capillar structure of the skin. The skin breathes bettter, has more nurishment and a better colour.

**CAN YOU SEE THE EFFECT AFTER ONE TRAINING?**

You can't see the effect after one training it takes at least 10 days. Without discipline and regular training, none of the methods will work on long term base. We only use natural techniques to stimulate cell regeneration and awaken the anti age function of the body. Follow the online training and get amazing results!

**IS IT POSSIBLE TO OVERTRAIN YOUR FACE MUSCLES?**

It is not possible to overtrain your face muscles, because physiologically face muscles differ from body muscles and they are without fascias. If you are not sure or it doesn't feel comfortable while doing face-gym please consult your doctor.

**WHAT IF I'VE HAD INJECTABLES ?**

If clients have recently had injectables they must wait 2 weeks before starting any Face-Gym exercises.

**WHAT IF I'VE RECENTY HAD FILLERS OR PEELS?**

If clients have recently had any Fillers or Chemical Peels they must wait 4 weeks before starting any Face-Gym exercises.
